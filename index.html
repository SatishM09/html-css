        Rajput made his film debut in the buddy drama Kai Po Che! (2013), for which he received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. He then starred in the romantic comedy Shuddh Desi Romance (2013) and as the titular detective in the action thriller Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! (2015). His highest-grossing releases came with a supporting role in the satire PK (2014), followed by the titular role in the sports biopic M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story (2016). For his performance in the latter, he received his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor.[6][7] Rajput went on to star in the commercially successful films Kedarnath (2018) and Chhichhore (2019).[8][9][10]
        Rajput attended St. Karen's High School in Patna and Kulachi Hansraj Model School in New Delhi.[24] According to Rajput, he had ranked seventh in the DCE Entrance Exam in 2003,[25] and secured admission in the Bachelor of Engineering (Mechanical Engineering) class in Delhi College of Engineering.[2] He was also a National Olympiad Winner in Physics.[26] In all, he cleared as many as 11 engineering entrance exams, including that for the Indian School of Mines.[2] After he started participating in theatre and dance, he rarely had time for studies, resulting in several backlogs which ultimately made him leave DCE.[25] He completed only three years of the four-year course before dropping out to pursue an acting career.[2]
        While a student at Delhi Technological University, Rajput enrolled in Shiamak Davar's dance classes.[27] It was only later that the idea of making a career in acting came to him, as some of his fellow students in the dance classes happened to be interested in acting and were attending Barry John's drama classes. Influenced by them, Rajput also joined the acting classes. Here, he found his passion for acting: "I found the experience liberating. I realised that I could communicate with the audience. I knew I wanted to do this forever."[28]

Within a few months of joining the dance class, Rajput was selected to be a member of Davar's standard dance troupe. In 2005, he was chosen to be one of the group of background dancers at the 51st Filmfare Awards. In 2006, he was part of the troupe that went to Australia to perform in the cultural program at the opening ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games. By this time, he was tired of engineering. He was happy and successful in the dance and drama classes, and decided to do what he was good at. He dropped out of engineering and devoted himself full-time to dancing and acting.[25]

To make a break into films, Rajput moved to Mumbai and joined Nadira Babbar's Ekjute theatre group, which he remained a part of for two and a half years.[27] During this time, he was featured in a TV advertisement for Nestle Munch, which became famous throughout India.[29]

        In 2008, the casting team of Balaji Telefilms saw Rajput's personality and acting talent while he was on stage for one of Ekjute's plays.[29] They invited him to audition for them and Rajput landed the role of Preet Juneja in Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil.[30] His character was killed quite early in the show, but he was such a popular character with the viewers that he was brought back for the series finale in the form of a spirit, looking on as his family celebrates after going through difficult times.[31]

In June 2009, Rajput began starring in Pavitra Rishta as Manav Deshmukh, a serious and mature character working as a mechanic to support his family. His work in this serial received wide appreciation, and Rajput received three major television awards for best male actor and most popular actor.[29] This performance was his breakthrough and gave him a stepping stone into films.[32] Initially when producer Ekta Kapoor cast him as lead for Pavitra Rishta while playing the parallel lead in Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil, Zee TV did not accept him. However, Kapoor convinced them to accept him.[33]

In May 2010, Rajput joined the dance reality show Zara Nachke Dikha 2.[34] He had already proven his acting talents by winning awards for his performance in Pavitra Rishta, and he wanted to establish that he had good dancing skills and could be trained further. In Zara Nachke Dikha, Rajput was a part of the Mast Kalandar Boys Team. He did the shooting for both Pavitra Rishta and Zara Nachke Dikha 2 at the same time.[34] On the Mother's Day special episode, his team dedicated a performance to his mother, who had died in 2002.[35]

In December 2010, Rajput participated in another dance-based reality show, Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 4, where he was paired with choreographer Shampa Sonthalia.[36]

In October 2011, Rajput decided to quit Pavitra Rishta to pursue a filmmaking course abroad, and in November 2011, Rajput quit the series and was replaced by Hiten Tejwani.[37] However, in October 2014, Tejwani paved way for Rajput who appeared in the final episode aired on 25 October 2014 as Manav.[38][39]
